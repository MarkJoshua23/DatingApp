>program cs have 2 areas, the service area and middlewares
>int are primitive type means the default value is 0
>when a new instance of this class is made, constructor is executed automatically
>nullable enable means vscode will warn u if the item can become null so u can make null exceptions
>make sure to dotnet new gitignore before pushing it to github
>you can gitignore files by going to git icon in sidebar then rightclick the file


===IMPORTANT=====
>if we use parameters '(string username, string password)' this accepts from query string
>if we use DTO ' (RegisterDto registerDto)' this accepts from
===SHORTCUTS=====
>ctrl p => search file
>ctrl . => lightbulb/quickfix



==ENTITY==
>Query
>Track changes happening
>Saving
>Concurrency
>Transactions => different actions happening that if one fails then all actions are not saved
>Caching
>Builtin conventions( 'Id' are automatically PK)
>Migrations
>microsoft.entityframeworkcore.sqlite ==> choose the net version
>microsoft.entityframeworkcore.design ==> for migration
>dotnet-ef for migration=> u need to install the tool globlly
>dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate -o Data/Migrations => this just creates a migration not a db
>dotnet ef database update => command to initial create a db based on migration or when theres an update to the entity
>migrate again if theres a change in columns and database update again
>use inheritance to DRY

>the controller parameters default looking for query parameter instead of request body

===DEBUGGING===
>stop by breakpoint
>go to next line 'step over'
>enter the function by 'step into'

===SERVICES===
>make interface using interface template
>make the service
>implement the interface in the service
>interface acts as a template so if you implement it it gives the required methods automaticaly
> AddScoped means its recreated per request, good for tokens
>IMPORTANT!!!! 
>The interface will be the one to be injected, the service only implements and makes the method that will run when interface is injected


===JWT===
>system.identitymodel.tokens.jwt =>create tokem
>microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.jwtbearer => use auth for endpoints
>[Authorize] emdpoints respone 401 unauthorized if the user is not authorized

===EXTENSIONS====
> used to clean program cs
> put the multiple builder.Services to the extension file and use just one on program cs
>always static
